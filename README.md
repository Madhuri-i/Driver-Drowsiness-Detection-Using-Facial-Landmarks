The Drowsiness Detection System is a real-time computer vision–based application designed to detect driver fatigue by monitoring facial features, particularly eye movements, using a standard webcam. The system continuously analyzes live video frames to identify signs of drowsiness such as prolonged eye closure and reduced blinking rate.

By calculating the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) from detected eye landmarks, the system determines whether the driver’s eyes remain closed beyond a predefined threshold duration. When drowsiness is detected, an alert mechanism is triggered to warn the driver, helping prevent accidents caused by fatigue.

This project is entirely software-based, cost-effective, and does not require specialized hardware, making it suitable for real-world deployment in vehicles. It demonstrates the practical application of computer vision techniques for road safety and real-time monitoring systems.
